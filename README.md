This is my portfolio to showcase some of my skills, although still learning. 
It includes the following:
* Fun facts about me
* Mini-projects apps deployed on Heroku
* My Grace Hopper Experience
* My resume (online & .pdf version)
* Contact Information; email, Twitter, LinkedIn

This was also a project initiated in my Software Development II course at Georgia Gwinnett College.
