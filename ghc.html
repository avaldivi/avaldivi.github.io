                        <p> I had the greatest opportunity to attend Grace Hopper in October 2015 in Houston, Texas as the first female student from Georgia Gwinnett College. I had an article written about from The Science of Technology Newsletter called 'Eureka'.</p>

                        <p> If you are unaware what this conference is all about, this is a conference to celebrate Women Technologists from all over the world. I was able to attend Chelsea Clinton and Sheryl Sandberg talks. I also opportunities to interview with reputable companies such as: Capital One, Travelers, GoDaddy, and Intuit.</p>
